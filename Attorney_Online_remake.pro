# 1. You need to get BASS and put the x86 bass DLL/headers in the project root folder
#    AND the compilation output folder. If you are compiling statically, you'll probably
#    need the .lib file too. MinGW-GCC is really finicky finding BASS, it seems. However,
#    even with the .lib file, you still need the DLL in the final output.
# 2. You need to compile the Discord Rich Presence SDK separately and add the lib/headers
#    in the same way as BASS. Discord RPC uses CMake, which does not play nicely with
#    QMake, so this step must be manual. If you are compiling dynamically, it's fine to
#    use the prebuilt libraries.
# 3. You also need to build QtApng (https://github.com/Skycoder42/QtApng).
#    Optionally, you may install it in /usr/share/qt5/plugins/imageformats, but if you do
#    so, then you must patch qapng.pri, qapngd.pri, png.pri, pngd.pri, z.pri, and zd.pri
#    such that they no longer point to the builds in the original project directory
#    (by removing those respective entries in QMAKE_PRL_LIBS and replacing them with
#    something like `-L$$[QT_INSTALL_LIBS] -lpng -lz`).
#
# Naturally, the build process becomes significantly less convoluted if you simply
# compile dynamically. If your primary distribution method is via the launcher, then
# a simple dynamic compilation is recommended.
